# Community

We have a lot of people using composer, and also many contributors to the
project.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to composer, please read the
[README](https://github.com/composer/composer).

The most important guidelines are described as follows:

> All code contributions - including those of people having commit access - must
> go through a pull request and approved by a core developer before being
> merged. This is to ensure proper review of all the code.
>
> Fork the project, create a feature branch, and send us a pull request.

## IRC / mailing list

The developer mailing list is on [google groups](http://groups.google.com/group
/composer-dev) IRC channels are available for discussion as well, on
irc.freenode.org [#composer](irc://irc.freenode.org/composer) for users and
[#composer-dev](irc://irc.freenode.org/composer-dev) for development.
